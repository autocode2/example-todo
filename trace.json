      "message": "Great! I've created two files for you: `index.html` and `src/App.js`. These files contain a simple React todo app that meets all your requirements. Let me explain the features and how to use the app:\n\n1. Adding a todo: Type in the input field and click the \"Add Todo\" button.\n2. Deleting a todo: Click the \"Delete\" button next to any todo item.\n3. Updating a todo: Edit the text directly in the input field for each todo item.\n4. Viewing the list of todos: All todos are displayed in a list.\n5. Marking a todo as complete: Click the checkbox next to a todo item.\n6. Filtering todos: Use the \"All\", \"Active\", and \"Completed\" buttons to filter the todos.\n7. Counting complete and incomplete todos: The count is displayed above the todo list.\n\nThe `index.html` file includes the necessary React and Babel scripts to run the app directly in the browser without any build steps. It also includes some basic styling to make the app look presentable.\n\nThe `src/App.js` file contains the entire React application logic, including state management and all the required functionality.\n\nTo run this app:\n\n1. Save both files in their respective locations (index.html in the root directory and App.js in the src folder).\n2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.\n\nThe app should work immediately without any further steps. You can add, delete, update, and filter todos, as well as mark them as complete or incomplete.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to explain or modify in the todo app?",
